            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>CArdinal <hi>Du Perron</hi> having made an Answer to the Book of the Most Excellent King JAMES about the Right of Kings; it pleased His Majesty to send for the late Dr. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> (a Divine whom he honoured with his especial Love, and whose Pen he had employed before in the like occasions) to confer with him about that Book, and to commit to him the Task of answering the Cardinal.

But when it began to appear abroad, the whole Edition (very few Copies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) perisht in the conflagration of <hi>London.</hi> Out of that Work, which is of good length, I have singled one Chapter, the XI. of the VIII.

               <hi>Papal Tyranny: OR, A DISCOURSE SHEWING</hi> What Tyranny the Popes have exercised over <hi>England</hi> for some Ages, under colour of Absolution and Satisfaction. And from what horrible Bondage <hi>England</hi> was delivered by the Light of the Gospel.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the end of Cardinal <hi>du Perron</hi>'s Book was to shake the Constancy of His Majesty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and to induce Him to submit His Crown to the Papal See; I think it expedient, yea and necessary, to shew what was the condition of the English, and what the ignominy and bondage of the Royal Crown, under the Empire of the Roman Prelate. This matter of Satisfactions leads us to that Discourse: for it was a principal Engine of the Pope to bring Kings under his Feet, for him to tread upon their Necks, and to prey upon <hi>England</hi> with the highest Insolency.</p>
            <p>The Dispute about Investitures and Collation of Benefices, is that for which most blood hath been spilt in <hi>Europe,</hi> since Christian Religion was planted in it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Quarrel above an hundred Battels were fought since <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As in the fourth and fifth Ages, the word <hi>Consubstantial</hi> was the Mark of the Orthodox, and in our days <hi>going to mass</hi> is the mark of Roman Catholicks; so in the eleventh and twelfth Ages, to maintain that the Right of Investitures and Collation of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks and Abbeys belonged not unto Kings and Princes, but to the Pope, went for the mark of a true Christian; and they that suffered for the defence of the Popes Claim, were called Martyrs, and put in the List of Saints, and were sure to do Miracles after their Death.</p>
            <p>In old time Popes were c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54870:4"/> punished and deposed Popes. They employed them sometimes about Embassies and other Services, as a Soveraign Prince will send his Subjects and Servants on his Errand.</p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>Italy</hi> took of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> three thousand Crowns for their Investiture; as of the Archbishop of <hi>Milan,</hi> and that of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> two thousand for theirs, according to the express Law of King <hi>Athalaricus</hi> in<note n="(a)" place="margin">Cassiod. var. l. 9. <hi>Ep.</hi> 13.</note>

            <p>But the Roman Empire being pulled down in the West, and <hi>Italy</hi> being fallen into the hands of the French, the Pope was inriched by the immense Liberalities of <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Meek, and from a Bishop was suddenly made a Temporal Prince. Being thus raised, he took advantage, after the death of <hi>Lewis,</hi> of the dulness of his Successors, distracted with great Wars, to make his Keys to clink with a great noise, and to terrifie the Princes and Nations on this side of the Alps, with the Thunder of his Excommunications. (For as for the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians his Neighbours, who at that time held still part of <hi>Italy,</hi> they never cared for the roaring of his Bulls.) By little and little the Papal Empire did so increase, that in the end the Popes made bold to strike at the Crowns of Emperours and Kings, and shoot <hi>Anathema's</hi> against them, giving and taking away Kingdoms, putting Interdicts upon their Provinces, and exposing them for a Prey to the next Conquerour.

            <p>The height of the Popes Power and Glory, and together the depth, and as it were the midnight of the darkest ignorance, was from the year 1073. upon which <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII. entred into the Papal See, and the year 1517. when <hi>Leo</hi> the X. having published great Pardons over all the Papal Empire, began to sell Heaven for ready money, and put to sale remission of sins, and deliverance of Souls from Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. This moved the people to search the Scriptures, to know what Ground such an infamous Traffick might pretend in the Word of God. In all that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, which was of four hundred fourty four years, Holy Scripture was a Book shut up unto the Princes and Nations of the West, and their whole Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in Adoration of Reliques and New Saints doing Miracles, in Pilgrimages, in Service of Images, in Visions of Souls returning from Purgatory, in running to get Pardons, in founding of Abbeys for Satisfaction and Redemption of the sins of the Founders, in making <hi>Croisada</hi>'s for Expedition into the Holy Land, and in trembling under the Popes Thunderbolts. Hardly was Christ acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Saints.

               <hi>Sigebert</hi> who lived then, and <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> almost his Contemporary, and Cardinal <hi>Benno,</hi> a Domestick of that Pope, write that when he saw himself near his Death, he called a Cardinal, the most confiding of all his Friends, to whom he confest, that <hi>he had greatly offended in the Pastoral Charge committed unto him, and had drawn the Wrath of God upon Mankind by the Devils Instigation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Quarrel began, because the Emperours after the Canonical Election of the Bishops and Abbots of their Empire, used to invest them with the Lands and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships belonging unto the Bishoprick or Abbey, putting a Ring and a Staff in their hand, and to receive the Oath of Allegiance from them. For the said <hi>Prelates</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Noble Lands in the Empire by the Concession of the Emperours, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Vote in their Election and in the greatest business of the Empire, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours thought it just and necessary that the said Prelates should make some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of it, and should not be received into a degree so important to the State, without the States consent, and without acknowledging the Emperour to be their Lord and Master. Besides, the Emperours according to the custom of the ancient Emperours which I represented before, would take some Present in money from the said Prelates, (which yet was a small thing in comparison of that which the Popes took since, and take still for the Annat, now that they have deprived the Emperour of his Right.) And herein the Emperours thought themselves groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in right. For besides that the Churches, Abbeys, and Priories were founded by the Liberality of Emperours and Princes of the Empire, the Emperour main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Armies for the Defence and Security of the said Prelates, wherefore it was reasonable that they should contribute towards the Charges.</p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> had the same Right in their Kingdom. So at the same time that Popes disputed those Investitures against Emperours, they laboured also in <hi>England</hi> to pluck that Flower from the Kings Crown, and to draw the profit to themselves. The first that stirred that Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arrel in <hi>England</hi> was <hi>Anselm</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> for when the Kings of <hi>England</hi> needy and greedy of money, borrowed of the Clergy great loans never to pay again, he to exempt himself from the subjection of Kings, laboured to make his Archbishoprick to depend meerly on the Pope, not on the King, although he had got it by the free Gift and Concession of the King.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Anselm</hi> then being promoted in the year 1092. to the Archbishoprick by King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> the King having given him freely that Great and Rich Place, soon after would extort from him a great sum of money for the exigence of his businesses, as claiming a Recompence for his Gift. <hi>Anselm</hi> refused to give it, and stealing privately out of <hi>England,</hi> went to Pope <hi>Ʋrban</hi> the II. who at that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54870:5"/> time was violently prosecuting, against the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Investiture, begun by his Predecessor <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh. This <hi>Ʋrban</hi> liking the Prudence and Dexterity of <hi>Anselm,</hi> made use of his Counsel, and gave him the Archbishops Pall, thereby voiding the Investiture which he had received from King <hi>William,</hi> and obliging him thereafter to depend on him, as also he did; so behaving himself ever since, as holding his Archbishoprick by the Popes Ordination, not by the Kings Concession. Whereby the King incensed, interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Anselm</hi> the entry into his Kingdom, confiscated the Lands and Estate of the Archbishoprick, and declared by an express Edict that his Bishops held their Places and Estates meerly from him, and were not subject unto the Pope for the same; And that he had the same Rights in his Kingdom as the Emperor had in the Empire. To which all the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> subscribed. Neither did any of them contradict it, but onely the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> as a Suffragant to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Intervention of Friends, <hi>Anselm</hi> made his Peace; But being returned from <hi>Rome,</hi> and keeping a strict league with the Pope, he began again soon after to disswade the Clergy from receiving Investitures from the King, wherefore he was constrained to fly the second time out of the Kingdom, and his Estate was again seized upon, and confiscated, of which he had obtained Restitution at his return.</p>
            <p>He came then to Pope <hi>Ʋrban,</hi> who received him with honour, as a Confessor suffering for the Cause of Christ. The year after, <hi>Ʋrban</hi> kept a Council at <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> in <hi>Auvergne</hi> where he granted full pardon of all sins to all that should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute for the Expedition into the Holy Land,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Matth. Paris in Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lielmo Rufo. Baronius.</note> and to them that should go in person, he promised a particular degree of Glory, and a preheminence in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise above the vulgar sort of Saints. In the same Council he decreed that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth it should not be lawful for any Prelate or Ecclesiastical Person to receive the Investiture or Collation of a Benefice or Church-Dignity from the hand of any Lay-person. But the Princes laught at these Decrees, and retained the possession of these Investitures.</p>

But <hi>Anselm</hi> being obliged with an Oath to the Pope, prevailed with the King that a Council should be gathered at <hi>London,</hi> Where he declared the Order he had from the Pope, that no Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should have the Power to confer any Investiture, and began to degrade the Bishops promoted by the Kings Nomination, and refused to consecrate some Bishops named by the King. The King angry, banish'd him out of his Kingdom presently, and confiscated his Estate.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:54870:5"/>
            <p>While these things past in <hi>England,</hi> Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> prosecuted the Quarrel of his Predecessors against the Emperour<note n="(g)" place="margin">The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> are found in <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> in the year 1106.

               </note>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. and seeing that all the Enemies whom the Pope had raised against him had been overcome and defeated, he did so work upon the Emperours own Son, that he made him rebel against his Father, and that Son coming upon his Father at unawares, with an Army surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him at Confluence, took the Crown, the Scepter, and Imperial Robe from him, and degraded him from the Empire. This broke the heart of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable old man charged with so many Victories, who died soon after with grief, so forsaken, that Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> would not suffer him so much as to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
            <p>That new Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth having slain his Father, past presently into <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Pope hoping to be recompensed for helping him in his Conspiracy against his Father, found himself deceived: For when he prest him to renounce the Rights of Investiture which his Ancestors (as <hi>Sigebert</hi> saith) had enjoyed above three hundred years, the Emperour grew very angry, and laying hold of this Pope <hi>Paschal,</hi> committed him to a close Prison: Neither would he release him, till he had renounced his Claim to the Investitures and Collations of Benefices, saying to him in scorn that which <hi>Jacob</hi> said to the Angel wrestling with him, <hi>I will not let thee go, before thou hast given me thy Blessing. Paschal</hi> then to redeem himself out of Captivity, granted to <hi>Henry</hi> that both he and the Popes after him, should leave unto the Emperours the peaceable enjoying of the Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Ecclesiastical Dignities by the Ring and the Staff. Also that none could be consecrated Bishop without an Investiture by the Emperour. And to make this agreement more Authentical, the Emperour and the Pope mutually obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Oath upon the Host of the Mass, which they received together. But because that Oath was extorted, the Pope did not think himself obliged to keep it. So he broke that Agreement, and excommunicated <hi>Henry,</hi> and all Princes usurping Investitures.</p>
            <p>That accident confirmed <hi>Henry</hi> the I. King of <hi>England</hi> in a resolution to retain the Investitures of his Kingdom. And that Order was kept in <hi>England</hi> for a long time. Onely the Popes, that they might not wrong their pretences by a long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>In the end King <hi>Richard</hi> was necessitated to send Embassadors to <hi>Rome</hi> to plead his Cause against the Archbishop. The Agreement was made with these Conditions. That the King might fortifie the Castle of <hi>Andeli,</hi> because it was a frontier near the French. But that to appease the Archbishop, and make him take off the Interdict from the Countrey, the King should give to the Archbishop all the Mills of <hi>Rouen,</hi> to enjoy them as his own, both he and his Successors; also all the Kings demains at <hi>Diepe,</hi> and at <hi>Louviers,</hi> and the Forrest of <hi>Haliermont,</hi> with all the appertenances of the same. That being done, they began again to sing Mass in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and by the Popes order Paradise was opened again unto the Normans. Then also the Order of the Dominicans first appeared, which was approved and confirmed by <hi>Innocent</hi> the III.

            <p>The fear of the Interdict in those days kept Princes and Nations in such fear, that there was nothing that the Pope could not obtain of the Soveraigns, as soon as he threatned their Land with an Interdict.</p>

It was that same year that Breasts of Flesh grew upon an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Damascus,</hi> as<note n="(d)" place="margin">203, &amp; 207.</note>
               <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> relateth. In the same time one <hi>Thurical</hi> an Englishman was in a rapture carried in the night to Purgatory, of which St. <hi>Nicolas</hi> is Governor; Where also he saw the mouth of Hell, whence a stinking smoak issued out, which, as it was revealed to him, came out of Tyths detained or ill paid, because there those men were horribly punisht who had ill paid the Tyths due to the Church. There also he saw the Souls for which no Masses were sung, put to a longer and sorer torment, and those poor Souls were barefoot, and had their Bellies flayed and raw. He saw also the Souls that came out of that fire besprinkled by St. <hi>Michael</hi> with holy Water. This is exactly related by <hi>Mat. Paris</hi> a Monk of St. <hi>Albons,</hi> superstitious according to the age he lived in. Then also came the Minorite <hi>Fryers</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> their Order being but lately instituted.</p>
            <p>This King <hi>John</hi> was unfortunate in War, and ill beloved of his own Subjects. King <hi>Philip August</hi> of <hi>France</hi> took from him <hi>Normandy, Anjou, Tourain, Polton,</hi> and part of <hi>Guienne.</hi> After these losses, being retired into <hi>England,</hi> he began to oppress the English, and tyrannically to rob the substance of the Nobles and the Clergy. Whereby he gave fair play to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. a man as crafty, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54870:8"/> stirring as ever was any; for he brought that King upon his knees, and got his ends of him, at the first occasion of quarrel, which was this.</p>
            <p>The Pope having chosen Cardinal <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> without the Kings consent, the King, angry at it, sent some Souldiers to <hi>Canterbury</hi> who used the Monks of <hi>Canterbury</hi> as Traytors, and expelled them out of <hi>England.</hi>
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">Matth. Paris, &amp; West monast. in Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanne.</note> He sent also reproachful Letters to the Pope, upbraiding him that the Popes got more money out of <hi>England</hi> than out of any Kingdom, and yet delighted to bring it into trouble, and to encroach upon the Liberties of the Crown; threatning, that if the Pope continued in these courses, he would shut up all the passages out of his Kingdom, that no money should pass out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> saying, that he had Prelates of sufficient capacity, and needed not to ask Justice of those that were far from him.</p>
            <p>Had a victorious King, well beloved of his Subjects, spoken thus, the Pope would have given him fair words, and spoken like a Father, that beareth with a fatherly meekness the infirmities of his dearest Son. So had his Predecessors born with all threatnings and ill words of <hi>William Rufus, Henry</hi> I. and <hi>Henry</hi> the II. before <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> death. But with this <hi>John,</hi> a weak and ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised Prince, he behaved himself otherwise. For after Letters of admonition, he gave order to some of his most confiding Prelates in <hi>England,</hi> that if the King should continue that Language, they should put an Interdict upon all <hi>England.</hi> Which was speedily executed.

            <p>Although the King did this most unwillingly, and with a heart full of rage and anguish, yet he sware (and it is inserted in the Letters) that he did this <hi>with a good will, of his own motion, and by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And at the same instant he did homage to the Pope, as a Vassel to his Liege Lord in the person of <hi>Pandulfus</hi> the Legat, and put at the feet of that Legat a sum of money which<note n="(i)" place="margin">

            <p>All that being done, yet the Legat went away without taking off the Interdict, and without absolving the King from his Excommunication, which he might have removed with speaking one word. But he returned beyond the Sea, carrying with him a mass of Treasure squeezed out of the Purses of the poor Engli h. And being come to the Coast of <hi>Normandy,</hi> he found King <hi>Philip August</hi> with a great Army, and a Fleet of a thousand Ships, staying only for the Wind to pass into <hi>England</hi> to conquer it.

Yet was not the Interdict taken off.</p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. published the <hi>Croisada</hi> against those that were reproachfully called <hi>Albigeois</hi> and <hi>Vaudois,</hi> because they did not acknowledg the Pope, called upon none but God alone, had no Images, did not go to Mass, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Purgatory, and read the Scripture.

            <p>Finally, in the year 1214. the Interdict was taken off by the legate, the Mass restored, the Churches and Church-yards opened, and the people reconciled by the Popes Concession, upon condition that the King should give to the Archbishop and Bishops, that had the charge of taking off the Interdict, forty thousand Marks.</p>
            <p>But the Barons of <hi>England,</hi> sore grieved to see the Crown of <hi>England</hi> so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based, asked of the King the enjoying of some liberties and priviledges which he had sworn unto them.

            <p>But the Barons did not care for the Popes Mandate, wherefore they were all excommunicated by the Pope, and their Lands and Lordships put in Interdict.</p>
            <p>The Prelates of <hi>England</hi> were commanded to publish that Sentence over all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with burning Candles, and ringing of Bells. At the same time, the Pope suspended <hi>Simon Langton</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> from his place, at the request of King <hi>John:</hi> And his brother <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> likewise. A worthy recompense for their helping of the Pope to make the King the Popes subject.

The Pope himself hindred the Auxiliary Forces of the <hi>Croisada</hi> that were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to help <hi>Frederick,</hi> and would not suffer them to advance.

            <p>Yet he continued to set on the Princes and Commons of <hi>Germany</hi> to rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Frederick:</hi> And so great was his hatred against <hi>Frederick,</hi> that <hi>Cuspinian</hi> and<note n="(a)" place="margin">Crontzius in an. Chr. 1249.</note>

But God gave victory to <hi>Frederick</hi> every where; for he defeated, in many combates, all the enemies which the Pope raised against him. So great was his animosity against that Emperour, that when Forces of the <hi>Croisada</hi> came out of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> or other parts, to sail into <hi>Syria,</hi> to defend <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Holy Sepulchre against the Saracens,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Matth.

Then he added, that the Popes are lavish of the blood of others, and that their end is to tread all the Princes of the world under their see, and to put on the horns of pride.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, persecution grew sore against those whom they called <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> and <hi>Albigeois,</hi> against whom the Pope caused the <hi>Croisada</hi> to be preached,

That the way to remedy that reproach, was, that the Pope should have in every Cathedral Church, and in every Abbey and Monastery of</hi> England, <hi>two Prebends, of which he should enjoy the Fruits.</hi> And in the same year the same
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54870:12"/> Pope called a Council at <hi>Bourges,</hi> where he made the same motion by his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. But he found Contradiction from the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> and could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass it.</p>

He took the Tythe, even of the Corn in the first Blade, that is, of the Crop of the year after. In these Exactions he was so urgent and so griping, that the Parishes were forced to engage the Chalices and Church-plate to satisfie his Covetousness. And he had certain Usurers with him, who lent money upon double use, to those that had no ready money. This caused a great Clamour and Lamentation over all the Countrey, but without effect. That money was employed by the Pope to invade many Towns belonging to the Emperour in <hi>Italy.</hi> And the Emperour could not defend them, because he was engaged against the <hi>Saracens</hi> in the <hi>Levant,</hi> where he took <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and put the affairs of the Christians in a flourishing state.

            <p>Reason and Right did require, that these great sums of money should have been employed to defray the Princes that raised Armies for the deliverance of the Holy Land.

That Great Prince soon after undertook that Voyage, but to his great ruine, confusion of the Christians, and destruction of his Kingdom. Yet the Pope never gave him any part of the money raised for that Expedition, nor to the Emperour, nor to any Prince that paid Armies, and fought for that Quarrel. All was poured into the Popes Coffers, as into a Gulf, and by him employed to make War against <hi>Frederick,</hi> for he broke presently the Covenant sworn to him.

He made his address unto the King; beseeching him in the Popes Name to help him to get ten thousand marks before hand of the English Clergy. And he brought forth Letters of Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> to the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> where these words are found. <hi>Being constrained by necessity, we have recourse to you confidently, and by the Counsel of our Brethren, we desire and expresly admonish your generality, and by Apostolick Writings we exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting command and commanding exhort you, that you relieve the Roman Church with such quantity and sum of money as our dear Son</hi> Martin, <hi>Clark of our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, shall declare unto you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that you so accomplish that which we desire of you, that we may commend your Devotion, and that we be not constrained to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed otherwise against you about that matter.</hi> Thus in case of denyal he threatned to force them to it by Excommunication.

               <hi>And when he had received what they sent, he would send it back with contempt, saying that it was not good enough, and commanded them to send better upon pain of Suspension and Excommunication.

Wherefore the miserable English complained that they were under a harder bondage than ever the Israelites in</hi> Egypt.</p>
            <p>War being happened between the English and the Scots, they made peace upon certain conditions.

            <p>The Pope had a desire to come into <hi>England,</hi> and pass through <hi>France,</hi> but the passage through <hi>France</hi> was denied him.

In the mean while, <hi>Martin</hi> was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wast poor <hi>England,</hi> sucking the substance of the people and the Clergy, and most part of the Benefices of <hi>England</hi> were held by Italians. In the end, the Nobles of the Land were forced by the heavy oppression to assemble themselves, and to give order that all the Papal Letters which daily came into <hi>England</hi> with new Tricks to catch money should be stopt. A bearer of those Trumperies was taken, and all his Bulls and Leaden Seals were taken from him, and he laid up in close Prison. About the same time, in <hi>Rogation</hi> week, the Popes Wardrobe at <hi>Lions</hi> was burnt with an accidental fire, and there the Letters of Homage and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission made to the Pope by King <hi>John,</hi> were consumed, as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi>

            <p>In the end, the King seeing his Kingdom exhausted by the Extortions of the Roman Court, although he trembled under the Papal power, yet he commanded <hi>Martin</hi> to depart out of the Kingdom, and for a farewel told him,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Diabolus te ad infernos inducat &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducat.</note>

            <p>The fourth day, an unusual thing happened: The Pope himself preached in a Church of <hi>Lions:</hi> His Text was, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>All ye that pass by, behold and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me:</hi> Then he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Sorrows to the five Wounds of Christ; The first was, The inundation of the <hi>Tartars;</hi> the second, The Schism of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> the third, The Heresie of those that were called <hi>Patterins, Buggerars, Jovinians,</hi> and <hi>Vaudois;</hi> the fourth, The desolation of the holy Land; the fifth and the most smarting, The Emperour <hi>Frederick,</hi> the Churches Enemy and Persecutor, whose Heresies and Sacriledges he set out at large.</p>
            <p>In that Council the people and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> complained by Deputies of the Extortions and Robberies of the Roman Court; but their Complaints were not regarded.</p>
            <p>There a Sentence of Deposition against the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Pope, whereby he was declared faln from the Imperial power, and all the Subjects of the Empire, as well in <hi>Germany,</hi> as in <hi>Italy, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Province,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54870:18"/> were absolved from the Oath of Allegiance sworn unto the said Emperour, with a prohibition by Apostolical Authority, to yield any obedience unto him, or to lend him any assistance, upon pain of Excommunication.

            <p>There also an Order was taken for the Voyage of the Holy Land, the Pope tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to pay the tenth part of his Revenue, and condemning the whole Clergy to pay the twentieth part of theirs for three years. He appointed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Officers to be receivers of that Contribution. He made an order, that all that should enter into the <hi>Croisada,</hi> should be exempted from all Tributes, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes, and subjection due to secular Lords, because by crossing themselves they put themselves under the protection of the Apostolick See. By this means the Kings lest as many Subjects as there were men that would put a Cross upon their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for then they claimed themselves to be the Popes Subjects.

That money was sent to the <hi>Lantgrave,</hi> whom the <hi>Pope</hi> had named Emperour instead of <hi>Frederick:</hi> That Emperour admired the baseness of the English, who suffered the <hi>Popes</hi> to strip them: whereas the <hi>Popes</hi> (said he) <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant fugientes &amp; fugiunt fugantes;</hi> The <hi>Popes</hi> oppress those that fear them, and tremble before them that resist them.</p>
            <p>The King having made some demonstration that he bore that yoak impatiently, and let fall some words of Discontent which were related unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> was so incensed, that he would presently have put an Interdict upon the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>England.</hi> Upon which a grave Remonstrance was made to him by Cardinal <hi>John,</hi> an English man by birth, and a <hi>Cistercian</hi> Monk, who represented to him, That the Holy Land was in danger; That the Greek Church had made a Schism from the Roman Church; That the <hi>Tartars</hi> were pillaging <hi>Hungary;</hi> That the Emperour was an Enemy to his Holiness; That <hi>France</hi> had a grudge against him, as being impoverished by so many Exactions, upon pretence of the Holy War; That the very people of <hi>Rome</hi> had expelled him out of <hi>Rome;</hi> Therefore that his Holiness having Enemies enough, he needed not to create more, lest he should see in a short time a general Revolt: And that it was no wonder if <hi>England,</hi> like <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> Ass, being sore laid on with blows, had spoken some words. But all this good counsel did not mitigate him. And to confirm him in his violent courses, presently Embassadors came to him out of <hi>England</hi> with deep submissions from the King, and a promise of greater obedience for the time to come. The Pope grown more arrogant with that humility, commanded all Prelates and beneficed men of <hi>England</hi> residing in their Livings, to send him the third part of their yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and the Non-resident the half: With the Addition of the clause, <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante,</hi> which derogated from all Customs, abrogated all Promises and Oaths, and revoked all sorts of Priviledges.</p>
            <p>In the end, after many denials about the Canonization of <hi>Edmund</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Pope to stroak the English, Canonized him, and made him a Saint seven years after his Death.

               <p>THis excellent Author truly observeth that the cruel Tyranny of the Popes over the Kings and People of <hi>England</hi> in the long Reigns of weak Kings was in great measure stopt by the stoutness of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the first. The Pope tryed his mettle by crossing the Election which the Monks of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by his consent had made of <hi>Robert Burnell</hi> to be Archbishop of that See, electing <hi>John Peckam,</hi> who got and kept the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>The Pope, encouraged with that success, sent a Bull to that Archbishop <hi>Peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> whereby he exempted the Clergy from paying Taxes to the King.<note place="margin">Ex Chron. Rob. Gisbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis.</note> The Clergy accordingly, when the Parliament had granted Subsidies to the King, refused to pay him any. Whereupon the King seized upon all the Archbishops Goods, forbad Annats and <hi>Peter</hi> Pence to be paid to the Pope, and put the Clergy out of his protection, and the safeguard of the Laws; so that if any would pillage the house of a Clergy-man, or even take away his Life, there was no Law against the Offender. This frighted the Clergy to their Duty.</p>
               <p>The Statute of <hi>Carlile</hi> made in that Kings Reign declareth,<note place="margin">35. Edv. 1.</note>
                  <hi>that the Holy Church of</hi> England <hi>was founded in the estate of Prelacy, within the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>by the Kings and Peers thereof. And that the many Ʋsurpations of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>set down in that Act, did tend to the annullation of the State of the Church, the disinheriting of the King and the Peers, and to the destruction of the Laws and Rights of the Realm, contrary to the Laws and Rights of the first Founders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last clause of that Statute sheweth, that the King and the State of <hi>England</hi> were deeply sensible of the Popes Extorsion in disposing of all the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal benefices of the Land, as contrary to the intention of the first Founders, which was to promote Gods Service by them, and to leave the patronage of them to their Families, not to make a prey ready for the Ambition and Avarice of a forrain Prelat.</p>
               <p>That Statute of <hi>Carlile</hi> did revive the acknowledgment of the Kings Rights, and the Liberties of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Since those Statutes, the Popes forbore to meddle with the Investiture of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Benefices and Dignities; till the Troubles about the Quarrel of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and the Weakness of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, made him attempt some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in that kind, but with a short-liv'd Success. And it may be truly said that those Statutes have made one half of the Popes Ejectment, of which <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth made the other half; and that they gave a sure footing to the Reformation in his days.</p>
               <p>But it is a wonder to me that it came not sooner, in a Nation so long, so horribly opprest, and so insolently trampled under the Popes Feet: seeing (if they had had Eyes to see) that all those Outrages were committed under a pretence of pennance, and promoting the Spiritual Good: For all the power which the Pope assumeth is <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia;</hi> And he will have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Christs saying to St. <hi>Peter, Feed my Sheep,</hi> gave power to the Pope to worry them, whensoever his Holiness shall judge that it is for their good. And whereas the Kingdoms of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> have also curbed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances of <hi>Rome,</hi> because they have found upon due Examination that the Popes had no ground for them in Divine Authority, why will they not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine also whether the Roman Doctrines of Purgatory, Indulgences, Worship of Images, and Invocation of Saints, which are so lucrative to <hi>Rome,</hi> be better grounded than their incroachments on the Rights of Kings and States? And how can they but see (but that a doom of blindness lieth upon these last corrupt Ages) that those Doctrines are spiritual Cheats to milk out the substance of the people, and plant the Roman Monarchy in all Monarchies?</p>
               <p>Some perhaps will say, That those Statutes and Premunires before alledged, have so broken the Popes power, that if his Spiritual Authority were acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54870:24"/> again in <hi>England,</hi> they would not or could not run into those antient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.

And then the charge of Censures and other Proceedings in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> fell so heavy upon them, that they could never recover themselves. And further, that whereas all Trade was driven in current Silver, only the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which neither toils, nor sweats, nor hazards any thing, will be paid all in Duc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That to seek for a Remedy of these Abuses at <hi>Rome,</hi> was such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable charge, by reason of three Instances and three Sentences necessary to be obtained, that it was in vain to attempt any such thing. This they cried out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a most grievous Yoak.</p>

               <p>They complained that the Popes did usurp as their own all the Revenues of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks during their vacancies, sometimes for divers years together; All which time the Churches were unrepaired, the Poor unrelieved, not so much as one Alms given; and the wealth of <hi>Spain</hi> exported into a forein Land which was richer than it self.

Of which one would think that he is in greater danger than I; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he appear before them in his new shaven Crown, and his Romish Priests Habit. For all the ill words which he bestoweth upon me I return hearty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that God sanctifie his good parts, and graciously reclaim him to his holy Truth, from which he hath bin miserably seduced.</p>
               <p>My second Adversary is Mr. <hi>Serenus Cressy. Doth he not know</hi> (saith he of me) <hi>how oft,</hi>

                     </gap>all in vain?</hi> I desire the Reader to observe the nimble juggling of Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> to make the world believe that which himself affirmeth not. I might in the same Stile say of an honest man, Doth he not know how oft he hath robbed upon the high ways, and particularly upon <hi>Shooters hill?</hi> and yet not affirm that he hath done so. And I might say of Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> Doth he not know how oft he hath done disservice to the King in the Irish Wars, and particularly in doing his utmost to seduce his Brother from His Majesties service to that of the Pope? and yet not affirm that he did so, though if I did affirm it, I should not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I answer then to Mr. <hi>Cressys</hi> Question, that I never knew of any such Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons made to me upon the Queen Mothers complaint, or of any Summons at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll before his Book came forth, nor he neither. Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> might have said with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruth, that a few days after the coming forth of my Book Her Majesty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ired that I might be forbidden to write any more, which was very far from sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning me to bring my proofs. And several persons of Honour and good Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit can remember what a dismal consternation there was at <hi>Somerset house</hi> when my Book appeared.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> also being deeply stung with the Truth of that Charge, as he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54870:28"/> by the extremity of his choler, will sting me in revenge with a foul asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon my Reverend Fathers memory; denying him to have bin a loyal Subject, and calling all <hi>France</hi> to witness for it. But the famousest Pen of <hi>France,</hi> that of Monsieur <hi>Balzac</hi> a Roman Catholick, giveth him a contrary Character, in a Letter to a him which is extant among his works. For after he hath extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his high parts, and yielded to him the Garland of Wit and Eloquence, he exalteth him more yet for his eminent Loyalty and Love to his King, shining in all his Writings; For which also he had solemn thanks given him by his King and the Council of State. But of nothing must we expect any thing beyond its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is much of the nature of Dogs, who will lift up their leg against things that are higher than themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> concludes his invective against my Father with a worse against the Confession of Faith of the French Reformed Churches; saying, that <hi>it obligeth their to be Traitors and Rebels, whensoever the Honour of God (that is the defence of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But here comes in the rear a bold Champion who sends me a defiance out of the Coffee-house, to make the Charge good which I laid against the English Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits.

And therefore I ought not to answer any Summons that issues not from Authority. But his Friends the Jesuits were so far from suing for such a Summons, that when my Book came forth, after they had clamoured and stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med four or five days, they employed the greatest strength they had in the Court to stop my Pen by Aurhority, from writing any more. This behaviour of theirs (for which I have undeniable proofs) is the greatest evidence that can be of their guilt; unless it be their silence, now well nigh eleven years. Whereas they ought to have sued their Accuser as soon as the Accusation came forth. And would they not have done it had they bin innocent?
